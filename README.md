# Youth For Earthwin

[![GitHub contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/Adoyle210/Youth-For-Earthwin.svg)](

## Description

Our application is a React Native project designed to promote an environmentally conscious lifestyle by reducing unnecessary car idling. This project was inspired by a group of high schoolers who took initiative in their school to promote no idling in school pickup/drop off areas. They successfully secured funding and permission from their school to put up no idling signs, and we are aiming to take their initiative to a wider audience through this app. The students were inspired by Earthwin, a non-profit organization that aims to inspire environmental consciousness in youth while building their leadership skills. We are working with Earthwin to develop this app that is a mini version of what the ultimate Earthwin app will be.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project was bootstrapped with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Expo](https://expo.dev/). Ensure that you have the latest versions of Node.js and npm installed before starting.

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [npm](https://npmjs.com/)
* [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)

The above software should be installed on your computer.

### Build and Installation

To build and run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Adoyle210/Youth-For-Earthwin.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory
```bash
cd Youth-For-Earthwin
```
3. Install the required npm packages
```bash
npm install
```
4. Start the expo server
```bash
expo start
```
Upon running `expo start`, the Expo CLI will provide a list of commands for viewing options. You will also see here a QR code, which can be scanned and used to interact with the app after Expo is downloaded from the App Store or Google Play Store.

## Features

### CO2 Emissions Calculator

This feature allows users to track and calculate the CO2 emissions at their school's pick-up/drop-off areas. By inputting the number of cars, the average idling time, and the frequency of pick-ups/drop-offs, users can get an estimate of the amount of CO2 emissions produced. This data can be used to:

- Advocate for the installation of no-idling signs at schools.
- Secure funding for environmental initiatives.
- Educate users on the impact of idling on the environment.
